# Mt Murchison - April 2025

**Mt Murchison** stands in the back of Arthur's Pass, in the South Island of New Zealand. At 2408 meters high, it doesn't quite make it into the top 100 lists, landing in position 101. [ClimbNZ.org.nz](https://climbnz.org.nz) lists the [White Glacier Route](https://climbnz.org.nz/nz/si/arthurs-pass/shaler-range/mt-murchison/white-glacier-route) as a Grade 1.

While I've climbed plenty of harder routes, my 15-year-old climbing partner has not. The main challenge is the 21km walk in along the Waimakariri River to Carrington Hut, then a left turn into the White River. This makes for a long, but achievable, first day.

Easter weekend just rained, with a few heavy rain warnings. The Waimakariri river, which the White River feeds into, had been flowing at ~40cum/s for the previous week. On the morning of the 21st it was flowing at 150cum/s but the peak rain is over. It can take a few days to drop back to normal levels after a rain event. 

This route requires many crossings of the Waimakariri river and the White river so the trip will have be to cancelled, or further delayed, if the rain persists.

As this is the first trip recorded on Adventures in Real Time, I expect there will be many technical hitches, but all going well, we'll manage to cover the bulk of the trip with sufficient video and telemetry to provide the immersive experience the site aims to deliver.
